# Food Nutritional Value

## Objective

This project aims to present the nutritional contents of foods whose data were gathered by the United States Department of Agriculture or **USDA.**

## Why the name of the GitHub repository is not aligned with FoodData Central of USDA?

This project was originally intended for Open Food Facts but because their data requires major cleanup and almost entirely unusable after cleanup, I decided to use the data from USDA instead which is not perfect but most of its data is still workable.
